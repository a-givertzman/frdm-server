# OpenCV Package Information

## Version

- **OpenCV Version**: `2.4.13`

OpenCV 2.4.13 is part of the OpenCV 2.x series, which was historically significant as it marked the transition of OpenCV from its original C API to a more modern C++ API. While the C API is still available in this version, it is considered deprecated and might not be available in future versions. If you are starting a new project or looking to update an existing one, it's recommended to use the C++ API or even consider more recent versions of OpenCV that come with additional features and improvements.
